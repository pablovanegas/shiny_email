**shiny_email** is a Shiny web application built in R for streamlining email management and composition. It leverages Shiny's powerful reactive framework to create an intuitive, web-based interface, making email tasks efficient and user-friendly.

## Features
- **Dynamic Email Composition**: Write and format emails with ease, using a Shiny-powered interface.
- **Email Management**: Send and manage emails directly through the app.
- **Custom Input Handling**: Collects and processes user input using reactive elements, ensuring a smooth experience.
- **Security Options**: Can be configured to handle secure email protocols.

## How It Works
The app is built entirely in R, utilizing the Shiny package:
- **UI Components**: Shinyâ€™s `fluidPage`, `input`, and `output` elements create a responsive web layout.
- **Server Logic**: Reactive programming manages email data, responding to user input in real-time. The `observeEvent` and `reactiveValues` functions help control app behavior, updating the interface as users interact.
- **Email Functionality**: Uses R libraries (like `mailR` or `blastula`) for email handling, ensuring flexibility and reliability in communication processes.
